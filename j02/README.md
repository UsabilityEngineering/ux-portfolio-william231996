# Crunchroll’s UX and Interface
## William Wang, 5/11/23

I use Crunchyroll to stream all my favorite anime on one platform. Crunchyroll, like many other streaming services, contains a UI with recommendations based on your favorite anime.

Crunchyroll’s interface exhibits an application of “aesthetic and minimalist design”, a heuristic evaluation that focuses on keeping the visual design of an interface focused on the essentials, thus improving effectiveness. Streaming service interfaces are mostly similar; their intention is to keep the user interested. This is done by feeding relevant information, otherwise known as “signal” to them, and limiting irrelevant information known as “noise”. Here is an example of Netflix’s UI, which is one of the best:

A streaming service’s UI should provide recommendations that catch the user’s attention and also pique their interest on unwatched shows. Recommendations such as these are created by a strong algorithm that takes account of previous shows watched and lays out a list of similar ones. Furthermore, the UI should have a variety of recommendation titles that attract curiosity. An example of this could be a title named “highest rated” which contains the highest rated shows on the platform. The combination of these two factors presents the user an inventory of unwatched gems to discover. 

When I log into Crunchyroll, I see an exceptional UI. The mapping of the interface is great: the search icon is clearly shown on the top right, plenty of recommendations are provided, and a variety of options such as access to your settings is shown on the bottom. After using Crunchyroll for many years I still have yet to create an error I couldn’t fix, so I would say it is very error tolerant. The most common error I’ve made is selecting the wrong anime, but I was able to revert back to the previous page in seconds. The only complaint that I have about Crunchyroll is that the UI provides a lot of irrelevant information. I’ve provided a clip of me scrolling through the interface to exhibit my frustrations, double click it to access it:

As you can see from the video, there is some unnecessary information that I would not expect from a streaming service. In particular, I am talking about the list of Japanese music artists and concerts that are recommended. I have no interest in this and was not expecting this from an anime streaming service as well. Also, there are some anime recommendation titles that I completely ignore such as, “Working for the Weekend”, “Relationship Status”, and “Amazing Anime Moms”. I’ve never watched any anime that could be relatable to the shows recommended under those titles, so I am unsure why I’ve received those. This results in me having to scroll throughout the whole page in order to find recommendation titles that I am actually interested in. I think Crunchyroll can improve on their UX, especially their application of “aesthetic and minimalist design”, as there is just too much irrelevant information provided.
